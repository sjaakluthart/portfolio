# portfolio
Portfolio website

## Setup

Clone the repo with git:
```
git clone git@github.com:sjaakluthart/portfolio.git
```

Requirements:
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)

After installing the listed requirements you can start developing! :)

I use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to process my Sass, you can use any processor you like.

To watch for Sass changes run:
```
compass watch <path to assets>
```

## Code Styling and Linting

I've installed some node modules to help with my general code styling. I use gulp as a task manager.

First install the node modules
```
npm install
```

To check scss code styling run:
```
make scss
```

To check js code styling run:
```
make jscs
```

To check js linting run:
```
make lint
```
